# EcoImpact-Tracker

## Overview
EcoImpact Tracker is a web application designed to help users monitor and reduce their carbon footprint through habit tracking, Google Calendar reminders, and Slack updates. Built for the [Hackathon Name], this project leverages Descope for secure authentication and integration with Google Calendar and Slack via Outbound Apps, offering a visually stunning, user-friendly interface created with Bolt AI. The app includes innovative features like a Carbon Challenge, tenant-based access control, and analytics, aligning with real-world sustainability needs.

## Features
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses Descope's "UserAuthFlow" with embedded Google Calendar and Slack connections.
- **Habit Tracking**: Input daily habits to estimate CO2 impact with AI-driven suggestions.
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Schedule eco-reminders automatically via Descope Outbound Apps.
- **Slack Integration**: Post CO2 savings and suggestions to a Slack channel using Descope tokens.
- **Carbon Challenge**: Join a challenge to set and track CO2 reduction goals via a custom Descope flow.
- **Tenant Management**: Restrict access to "TeamEcoA" and "TeamEcoB" teams using Descope tenant controls.
- **Analytics**: Display security audit logs for transparency.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time CO2 charts, progress bars for carbon challenges, and gamification (badges, leaderboard).
- **User-Friendly Design**: Onboarding tour, tooltips, dark mode, and responsive layout.
